you can perform following steps for run this project:

Step 1: python a_star.py (This is an A* algorithm to find a path from a starting point to a desired destination in a grid with obstacles)
Step 2 : python a_star_variant.py (indicate a path-finding program using the A* search algorithm on a grid-based maze with obstacles.)
Step 3: python a_start_bothside.py (Implemented bidirectional A* search algorithm to find a path through randomly generated obstacles in a 2D grid, with interactive visualization of the search process and obstacles.)
